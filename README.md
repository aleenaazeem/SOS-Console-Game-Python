# SOS-Console-Game-Python
1. Non GUI (Console) SOS Game developed in Python
2. How i created this game was by using dictionary
3. Storing S and Os in dictionary
4. The loop runs for 36 times as there are 36 boxes and each of them needs to be filled
5. There are two separate checks one for S and one for O. For O, we check left and right, up and down, right diagonal, left diagonal
6. For S we check if O is the next one and S is after that O. SOS is checked diagonally, vertically and horizontally. 
7. The boxes were numbered and if an S lands on 5 and there is an O on 6 and an S on 7 then its an SOS.
8. In this code there is a tally going on. Whoever makes the most SOS wins.
